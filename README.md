The GeoByte Project is a dynamic full-stack web app that combines React and Spring Boot for efficient delivery management and optimized routes. With React on the frontend, users experience a seamless interface, while Spring Boot empowers the backend for robust delivery process handling. Security is reinforced using JWT, providing a secure environment for sensitive data.

The application offers insights into cost-efficient and expensive routes for informed decision-making. Furthermore, it utilizes an H2 in-memory database, enhancing data management and accessibility.
